I guess I have blog now, this started with me finding <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/">this funny little project</a> that had ready to use css files and wanting to mess around with it

I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna write about here but I'm a Linux user and saying I'm into ricing is an understatement so I'm probably gonna have some guides and rice updates

Other than Linux ricing and coding my other hobbies are cubing and technical Minecraft which is a very disconnected set of hobbies now that I think about it...

So don't expect much to come from here, but whatever does get posted will be because I found it cool and I hope you find it as well!
