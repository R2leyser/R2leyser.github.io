    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my website!</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm R2leyser, a Brazilian dev that doesn't do any development.
    I have very little projects and I don't know why people think I can code well</p>

    <p>I have learned C, C++, typescript, javascript, python and a little bit of Rust and Go, when I'm done making this I hope I will be able to write html and css aswell</p>

    <p>This website will host my blog and a small portfolio because why not</p>

    <p>that's all :)</p>
