<h1>The first proper post!</h1>

<article>
<p>
I guess I have blog now, this started with me finding <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/">this funny little project</a> that had ready to use css files and wanting to mess around with it
</p>

<p>
I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna write about here but I'm a Linux user and saying I'm into ricing is an understatement so I'm probably gonna have some guides and rice updates
</p>

<p>
Other than Linux ricing and coding my other hobbies are cubing and technical Minecraft which is a very disconnected set of hobbies now that I think about it...
</p>

<p>
So don't expect much to come from here, but whatever does get posted will be because I found it cool and I hope you find it as well!
