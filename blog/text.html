<h1>Crazy text time!</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone! This is an update post about some stuff on the website</p>

    <p>I honestly didn't think it would be so much work or that I would be so excited about doing front end. Like this was supposed to be a one day thing that I might finish now I have been non-stop working on this and thinking about it for the 4th day.</p>

    <p>But anyways, I have added some stuff to it, other than some redesigning on the main page I now have the ability to do <span class="waving-text" id="wavingText">Celeste style waving text</span>, <span class="gradient-text">gradient text in the middle of the article</span> and <span class="waving-text gradient-text" id="wavingText">both at the same time</span> (thanks Striking) which I find quite cool.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure why they look so choppy when combined but I'm just gonna live with it because I don't know how to fix it.</p>

    <p>It has been a very interesting experience to write this and I'm almost happy enough with the framework I have built - if you can call it that - that I can just write posts and have them look cool. I'm also realising that in the future this paragraph is gonna make no sense because I will be done with it... oh well.</p>

    <p>I might add some new fun text effects in the future but for now I don't even know what I would add, either way that's about all I have to talk about for the time being and I'm probably gonna redo the blog index soon.</p>

    <p>That's all I have been up to rlly so I'll see you when I have something interesting to post!</p>
